# push_swap

### The subject 
<pre>
      The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project:
data must be sorted.

      You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions

to manipulate both stacks.

      Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays

on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,

that sorts the integers received as arguments.

      Easy?

       We’ll see...

### The Rules

• You have 2 stacks named a and b.

• At the beginning:

◦ The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers

which cannot be duplicated.

◦ The stack b is empty.

• The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the

following operations at your disposal:

**sa (swap a):** Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.

Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.

**sb (swap b):** Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.

Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.

**ss : sa and sb** at the same time.

**pa (push a):** Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.

Do nothing if b is empty.

**pb (push b):** Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.

Do nothing if a is empty.

**ra (rotate a):** Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.

The first element becomes the last one.

**rb (rotate b):** Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.

The first element becomes the last one.

**rr : ra** and rb at the same time.

**rra (reverse rotate a):** Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.

The last element becomes the first one.

**rrb (reverse rotate b):** Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.

The last element becomes the first one.

**rrr : rra and rrb** at the same time.

### Bonus Part

• Write a program named checker that takes as an argument the stack a formatted

as a list of integers. The first argument should be at the top of the stack (be careful

about the order). If no argument is given, it stops and displays nothing.

• It will then wait and read instructions on the standard input, each instruction will

be followed by ’\n’. Once all the instructions been read, the program has to

execute them on the stack received as an argument.

If after executing those instructions, the stack a is actually sorted and the stack b

is empty, then the program must display "OK" followed by a ’\n’ on the standard

output.

• In every other case, it must display "KO" followed by a ’\n’ on the standard output.

• In case of error, you must display "Error" followed by a ’\n’ on the standard error. Errors include for example: some arguments are not integers, some 

arguments

are bigger than an integer, there are duplicates, an instruction doesn’t exist and/or

is incorrectly formatted.
